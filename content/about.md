# About Me

Hi there! Welcome to my digital space where pixels meet purpose and code becomes creativity.

## Who I Am

I'm a passionate developer exploring the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence, modern web development, and creative technology. My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and an appreciation for both the technical and artistic sides of development.

## What I Do

I specialize in building modern, responsive web applications using the latest technologies:

- **Frontend Development**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Working with LLMs, AI-powered development tools, and intelligent user experiences
- **Creative Coding**: Bringing artistic elements into functional web applications
- **Developer Experience**: Optimizing workflows and exploring new tools that make coding more enjoyable

## My Approach

I believe in:

- **Learning in Public**: Sharing knowledge, documenting discoveries, and building community
- **AI-Augmented Development**: Leveraging tools like Cursor and Windsurf to enhance productivity while maintaining code quality
- **Pixel Perfect Design**: Attention to detail matters, whether it's in code architecture or visual design
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and benefiting from the amazing developer community

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm particularly excited about:

- Exploring AI-driven development workflows
- Building this blog template as an open-source project
- Creating content about modern web development practices
- Experimenting with pixel art aesthetics in contemporary web design

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you might find me:

- Creating pixel art and digital illustrations
- Playing retro games that inspire my aesthetic choices
- Reading about emerging tech trends and AI developments
- Participating in developer communities and meetups

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, sharing ideas, and collaborating on interesting projects. Whether you want to discuss the latest in AI development, share your own projects, or just chat about tech over coffee (virtual or otherwise), I'd love to hear from you!

Feel free to reach out through any of the channels on my [contact page](/contact).
