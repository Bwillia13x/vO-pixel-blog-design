Building an AI-augmented valuation platform requires access to comprehensive financial data. After extensive research into financial data providers, I've compiled this detailed comparison to help developers choose the right APIs for their projects.

## Project Context and Requirements

When building "Intrinsic Edge," a 12-week MVP for a value-investing platform using a modern stack (Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, DuckDB+Parquet for local time-series, PGVector for embeddings), the chosen financial data APIs must provide:

- **Comprehensive Fundamentals**: Deep company financials with 10+ years of history
- **Market Data**: Historical stock price time series and real-time quotes
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear documentation and generous free tiers for prototyping
- **Permissive Licensing**: Suitable for prototype applications without hefty subscriptions

## API Comparison Overview

I evaluated 7 popular financial data APIs based on coverage, pricing, and developer experience:

### 1. Alpha Vantage
**Best for: Reliable basic data with official exchange licensing**

- **Fundamentals**: Basic financial statements (5 years history)
- **Market Data**: Real-time and historical prices (20+ global exchanges)
- **Free Tier**: ~25 API calls/day, no credit card required
- **Pricing**: Premium starts at $50/month

**Pros**: Official NASDAQ data vendor, comprehensive documentation
**Cons**: Limited fundamentals depth, strict rate limiting

### 2. Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)
**Best for: Comprehensive endpoints and structured data**

- **Fundamentals**: 150+ API endpoints, 5+ years free (30 years paid)
- **Market Data**: End-of-day prices included
- **Free Tier**: 250 calls/day with most endpoints accessible
- **Pricing**: $22-149/month for premium features

**Pros**: Excellent API structure, broad data coverage
**Cons**: Free tier historical depth limited, licensing restrictions for public apps

### 3. Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
**Best for: Quick prototyping and historical price data**

- **Fundamentals**: Basic financials (4 years history)
- **Market Data**: Decades of historical data for global markets
- **Free Tier**: 100% free, no account needed
- **Pricing**: Community-supported, no official paid tier

**Pros**: Extensive price history, easy Python integration
**Cons**: Unofficial API, licensing concerns for commercial use

### 4. Tiingo
**Best for: Clean historical price data**

- **Fundamentals**: 20+ years (paid add-on required)
- **Market Data**: 30+ years of EOD data for 65,000+ tickers
- **Free Tier**: 1000 calls/day for price data only
- **Pricing**: $10/month + fundamentals add-on

**Pros**: Excellent price data quality, good documentation
**Cons**: Fundamentals not included in free tier, U.S.-only coverage

### 5. Polygon.io
**Best for: Real-time data and modern API design**

- **Fundamentals**: Basic financials (2-15 years, U.S. only)
- **Market Data**: Real-time and historical data with WebSocket support
- **Free Tier**: 5 calls/minute, all endpoints accessible
- **Pricing**: $29/month for higher limits

**Pros**: Real-time capabilities, developer-friendly documentation
**Cons**: Limited fundamental data depth, U.S. market focus

### 6. Finnhub
**Best for: Global coverage and earnings transcripts**

- **Fundamentals**: 30+ years globally, includes alternative data
- **Market Data**: Global real-time quotes and historical data
- **Transcripts**: 15+ years of earnings call transcripts
- **Free Tier**: 60 calls/minute, fundamental data included
- **Pricing**: $49-99/month for premium

**Pros**: Global coverage, earnings transcripts, feature-rich
**Cons**: Data accuracy variations, complex endpoint structure

### 7. EOD Historical Data (EODHD)
**Best for: All-in-one comprehensive solution**

- **Fundamentals**: 30 years worldwide (70+ exchanges)
- **Market Data**: Global coverage with bulk download options
- **Free Tier**: Limited (mainly for testing)
- **Pricing**: $59.99/month for fundamentals

**Pros**: Most comprehensive data, high quality, unified licensing
**Cons**: Expensive for MVP phase, overkill for simple prototypes

## Key Findings and Trade-offs

### Free vs. Paid Considerations

**No completely free API offers unlimited 10+ year fundamentals.** Most free tiers cap historical data around 5 years, with deeper history requiring paid plans.

**Stock price data is more accessible** - Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Tiingo all provide extensive historical price data in their free tiers.

**Licensing matters for public applications** - Many free tiers restrict commercial use or data redistribution. Plan accordingly for public-facing applications.

### Integration Complexity

**Modern APIs** (Polygon, Finnhub) offer better developer experience with interactive documentation and WebSocket support.

**Established providers** (Alpha Vantage, FMP) have mature ecosystems with Python/JS libraries and extensive community support.

**Data quality varies** - Official exchange partnerships (Alpha Vantage) provide higher reliability than scraped sources (Yahoo Finance).

## Recommended Strategy

For a 12-week MVP, I recommend a **hybrid approach**:

### Primary Stack
- **Financial Modeling Prep** for fundamentals and company data
- **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)** for bulk historical price downloads
- **Finnhub** for extended history and specialized data (transcripts)

### Implementation Approach

1. **Start with FMP's free tier** (250 calls/day) for core financial statements
2. **Use yfinance for price history** - download decades of data locally to DuckDB
3. **Supplement with Finnhub** for 10+ year fundamentals where needed
4. **Plan upgrade path to EODHD** for production scaling

This combination provides:
- ✅ Cost-effective prototyping
- ✅ Comprehensive data coverage
- ✅ Local caching capability
- ✅ Clear upgrade path

### Code Example

```python
import yfinance as yf
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Yahoo Finance for price history
def get_price_history(symbol, period="10y"):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    return ticker.history(period=period)

# FMP for fundamentals
def get_fundamentals(symbol, api_key):
    url = f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/income-statement/{symbol}"
    response = requests.get(url, params={"apikey": api_key})
    return response.json()

# Store in DuckDB for fast querying
prices = get_price_history("AAPL")
fundamentals = get_fundamentals("AAPL", your_api_key)
```

## Future Considerations

As your platform grows:

1. **Monitor API usage** and upgrade tiers as needed
2. **Implement robust caching** to minimize API calls
3. **Consider EODHD migration** for production scale
4. **Ensure licensing compliance** for public applications

The financial data landscape is rich with options. Start lean with free tiers, validate your use case, then invest in premium data sources as your platform proves its value.
